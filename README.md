This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Prisma

- install prisma vs-code extension

Prisma ORM is a database toolkit that simplifies database access in web applications. It allows developers to interact with databases using a type-safe and auto-generated API, making database operations easier and more secure.

- Prisma server: A standalone infrastructure component sitting on top of your database.
- Prisma client: An auto-generated library that connects to the Prisma server and lets you read, write and stream data in your database. It is used for data access in your applications.

```sh
npm install prisma --save-dev
npm install @prisma/client
```

```sh
npx prisma init
```

### Connect Supabase with Prisma

[Useful Info](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/prisma)

- add to .env

```bash
DATABASE_URL=""
DIRECT_URL=""
```

- DATABASE_URL : Transaction + Password + "?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"
- DIRECT_URL : Session + Password


- npx prisma migrate dev --name init
- npx prisma db push

npx prisma migrate dev --name init creates a new migration for your database schema
changes and applies it, while npx prisma db push directly updates the database schema without creating a migration. In the context of databases, a migration is set of operations, that modify the database schema, helping it evolve over time while preserving existing data.

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

[Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/tools/prisma-studio) is a visual editor for the data in your database. 

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
